## Adjustments Made

### Print (A4 Page)
- **Width**: 180mm (full content width)
- **Height**: Auto-calculated based on aspect ratio
- **Max Height**: 28mm (allows proper display)
- **Object Fit**: Contain (maintains aspect ratio)

### Screen Display
- **Width**: 100% (up to 800px)
- **Height**: Auto-calculated
- **Max Height**: 120px
- **Object Fit**: Contain

## Height Calculation

For 966x148 image at 180mm width:
```
Aspect ratio = 966 / 148 = 6.527
Height at 180mm width = 180mm / 6.527 = 27.6mm
```

Setting max-height to **28mm** ensures the image displays properly without distortion.

## Why This Works

### Original Setting (15mm)
- ❌ Too small for wide image (6.5:1 ratio)
- ❌ Would compress/distort
- ❌ Hard to read

### New Setting (28mm with auto height)
- ✅ Proper aspect ratio maintained
- ✅ Clear and readable
- ✅ No distortion
- ✅ Professional appearance
- ✅ Still compact (28mm ≈ 1.1 inches)

---

## Page Layout Impact

### Top Space Usage
- Top Margin: 5mm
- Header Image: ~28mm (calculated height)
- **Total Top Space**: ~33mm

### Content Area
- Total A4 Height: 297mm
- Used by margins: 10mm (5mm top + 5mm bottom)
- Used by header: 28mm
- **Available for content**: 259mm

Still plenty of space for certificate content!
