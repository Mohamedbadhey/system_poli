====================================
FIX: PHP Temp Directory Error
====================================

ERROR: finfo_file(C:\xamppp\tmp\php6463.tmp): Failed to open stream

PROBLEM: Your php.ini has the wrong path (xamppp with 3 p's instead of xampp with 2 p's)

SOLUTION:

1. Open: C:\xampp\php\php.ini

2. Search for: upload_tmp_dir

3. Change FROM:
   upload_tmp_dir = "C:\xamppp\tmp"
   
   TO:
   upload_tmp_dir = "C:\xampp\tmp"
   
   (Remove the extra 'p')

4. Also search for: sys_temp_dir
   
   If it exists, change:
   sys_temp_dir = "C:\xamppp\tmp"
   
   TO:
   sys_temp_dir = "C:\xampp\tmp"

5. Save the file

6. Restart Apache in XAMPP Control Panel

7. Try uploading again

====================================
ALTERNATIVE WORKAROUND:
====================================

If you don't want to edit php.ini, create the directory:

1. Create folder: C:\xamppp\tmp
   (with 3 p's to match your config)

2. Restart Apache

3. Try uploading again
